== Introduction






=== Purpose & Scope
This document specifies architecture and software design decisions for the app MooLah.
The intended audience of this document is the developers, designers, and software testers of MooLah.

=== Software Overview
MooLah is a desktop CLI application that help users track their expenses.
The App supports many other extensions such as budgeting, planning and reminders.
In particular, it is tailored to students in National University of Singapore who dine frequently in school canteens.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SinglePanelView`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.


The content being shown in the `MainWindow` is managed by the ``SinglePanelView`` which supports the following operations:
``SinglePanelView#viewPanel(panelName)``
``SinglePanelView#hasPanel(panelName)``
``SinglePanelView#getPanel(panelName)``
``SinglePanelView#setPanel(panelName, panel)``

image::SinglePanelViewClassDiagram.png[]

Users may change between the visible panels through the CLI by using the `view` command.
The following sequence diagram shows the events which occur in order to change the the UI component displayed in the main window.

image::ViewPanelSequenceDiagram.png[]



[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MooLahParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the MooLah data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `MooLah`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `MooLah` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the MooLah data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo functionality is facilitated by `ModelHistory` which is an instance-level member for models.
Internally, it stores model snapshots by using two stacks: `pastModels` and `futureModels`.
With the addition of model history, now `Model` also supports these operations:

* `Model#addToHistory()` -- Moves the history forward by saving the current model snapshot in its past history and clearing the future history.
* `Model#rollback()` -- Restores the state to the immediate previous model in the history.
* `Model#migrate()` -- Forwards the state to the immediate next model in the history.

`ModelHistory` only stores histories of models which were about to be (or are going to be) executed by model-changing commands.
As some of the commands available are intuitively not undoable (e.g. `help`), we make commands extend to either `UndoableCommand` or a non-undoable `Command` classes.
So, the `Model#addToHistory()` will only be called if the command to be executed is an instance of `UndoableCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The current `ModelHistory` is now empty.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `add d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 ...` command to add an expense.
The `add` command, being an `UndoableCommand`, calls `Model#addToHistory()`, which saves the state of the model just before the command executes to `pastModels`, and `futureModels` is cleared.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `delete 1` to delete the first expense on the list. The `delete` command, also an `UndoableCommand`, calls `Model#addToHistory()`, inserting another entry to the `pastModels` and clearing `futureModels` again.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addToHistory()`, so the model will not be saved into `ModelHistory`.

Step 4. The user now decides that deleting the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#rollbackModel()`, which will retrieve the immediate previous model in history, adding the current model to the future history of the retrieved model, and restores the model according to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If `pastModels` is empty, then there are no previous models to roll back. The `undo` command uses `Model#canRollback()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo command works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Inversely, the `redo` command calls `Model#migrate()`, which retrieves the immediate next model in history, adds the current model to the past history of the retrieved model, and resets the model according to that snapshot.

[NOTE]
If `futureModels` is empty, then there are no snapshots to be redone. The `redo` command uses `Model#canMigrate()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire model.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual commands have their own counter-command that can negate the effects.
** Pros: Quite intuitive (e.g. for `add`, just do `delete` to counter it).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

We choose Alternative 1 as this approach will be less likely to cause problems specific to restoring the state to the way it was before the execution of a command,
as some commands will create a problem specific on their own which might not be supported by the proposed counter-command.
As an example, to undo `delete 3`, we must re-add that expense to that specific position, which at the moment is not supported
by the `add` command.

// end::undoredo[]


// category::budget[]
=== Budget feature
==== Implementation

The budget feature allows users to add a budget and track expenses under this budget.
When a budget is added, it is automatically set to the primary budget, and all expenses added after that
will be tracked under this budget. If the user wants to track an expense under a different budget, he
switches to the target budget first, before adding the expense.

Each `Budget` has 8 fields:

* description: `Description` - budget name
* amount: `Price` - amount of budget limit
* startDate: `Timestamp` - the start date of the budget (for the current period)
* endDate: `Timestamp`- the end date of the budget (for the current period)
* period: `Period` - the recurring period of the budget
* expenses: `ObservableList<Expense>` - the list of all expenses under this budget
* isPrimary: `boolean` - a flag indicating the primary status of this budget
* proportionUsed: `Percentage` - the proportion of the total amount that has been used up

image::BudgetClassDiagram.png[]


Each budget, once added, will recur infinitely. This is achieved by the Budget#refresh() method, which checks whether
the budget has expired, and refreshes it to a new period if necessary, upon launching MooLah.

A budget is like a sliding window that moves in the positive direction of time axis. The window has a fixed size,
which is the period of the budget. Only expenses within the current window will be shown in the app. Every time
the budget refreshes, the window "slides" to the next period, starting with an empty screen that gradually gets
populated with newly added expenses over time.

A budget keeps a list of all expenses ever been tracked by this budget, including historical ones. Additionally,

it has a method Budget#getCurrentPeriodExpenses() that generates a filtered list of expenses within the current budgeting
period, which interacts with GUI to be shown in the current screen.

The fundamental classes of the budget feature are:

* `Budget` : main functional backend class
* `JsonAdaptedBudget` : for storage of a `Budget` object in Json format
* `UniqueBudgetList` : a list of non-duplicate budgets in MooLah
* `AddBudgetCommand` and `SwitchBudgetCommand` : budget-related commands
        `AddBudgetCommand` creates a new `Budget` and adds it to `UniqueBudgetList`
        `SwitchBudgetCommand` switches the primary budget to the specified budget
* `AddBudgetCommandParser` and `SwitchBudgetCommandParser` : for parsing CLI input into commands


Here are the class diagrams of the two key commands related to Budget:

AddBudgetCommand: Adds a new Budget to MooLah
image::AddBudgetCommandClassDiagram.png[]

SwitchBudgetCommand: Switches the primary Budget to another
image::SwitchBudgetCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Additionally, util class `Percentage` wraps a percentage for easier calculation and validation of proportionUsed.

image::PercentageClassDiagram.png[]


The following sequence diagram shows how the add budget operation works:

image::AddBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]


NOTE: The lifeline for `AddBudgetCommandParser` and `AddBudgetCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to
a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens to budgets when the app launches and when a new expense is added:


image::BudgetActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Since Budget already keeps a list of Expenses, should Expense have a Budget field?

* **Alternative 1:** Expense has a Budget field
** Pros: Easier to manage expenses.
** Cons: Causes cyclical dependency, and reduces testability. Also, this will cause infinite loop when creating
JsonAdaptedExpense and JsonAdaptedBudget.
* **Alternative 2:** Expense does not have reference to Budget
** Pros: Less coupling.
** Cons: When reconstructing MooLah from json file, system does not know which budget to add the past expenses to.
* **Solution (Current implementation):**
Each Expense keeps a budgetName field which indicates the name of the Budget it is tracked under. Since UniqueBudgetList
checks for duplicate budget names, a name is sufficient to identify a Budget. Besides, since budgetName is of
`Description` type instead of `Budget` type, it is easy to convert to String, and resolves infinite loop when creating
json files. Also, the resulting JsonAdaptedExpense file will not be too long, since the "budgetName" property stores
only the budget name instead of the full budget object.


===== Aspect: Must every Expense be tracked under a Budget? Can one Expense be tracked under multiple Budgets?

* **Alternative 1:** Every Expense must be tracked under one, and only one Budget.
** Pros: Budgets would be a partition of all Expenses, which makes generating statistics (pie charts, etc.) easier.
** Cons: User would not be able to track Expenses that fall under multiple Budgets.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow expenses without a Budget.
** Pros: More flexible budgeting experience.
** Cons: Internal logic would be very confusing. GUI and statistics would be harder to implement.
* **Solution (Current implementation):**
Adopt Alternative 1. Every Expense must be tracked under one and only one Budget. If the expense is added before
adding any budgets, a default budget with a huge limit is created for tracking all expenses without a proper budget.
This ensures that the main screen has a budget and shows a budget status bar at all times. Besides, it leads to neater
statistics.
// end::budget[]

// category::events[]
=== Events feature
==== Implementation

The Events feature allows users to add events that are supposed to occur on a future date. On launch, MooLah will
remind users of upcoming events. MooLah will also notify the user about any events that are supposed to have
transpired, and allow them to automatically add these events as expenses.

The Events feature supports the `add`, `delete` and `events` command words.

Events are added the same way expenses are added on the command line. When the user inputs an add command,
MooLah determines whether an event or an expense should be added based on the date the user inputted in his command.
This is illustrated below:

image::AddExpenseOrEventActivityDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how MooLah handles transpired events on launch:

image::TranspiredEventsSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. When MooLah launches, the `start` method of `UiManager` is called. `UiManager` then calls the `handleTranspiredEvents`
of `MainWindow`, which fetches all transpired events and notifies the user about them. It does so by first obtaining the
transpired events from the `Timekeeper` class by calling a series of getter methods.

2. Once the transpired events have been obtained, for each transpired event, a new `TranspiredEventWindow` will be
constructed. The transpired event will then be passed via `show`, a method of the newly constructed `TranspiredEventWindow`.
`show` will create a popup window that details the transpired event, and asks the user whether it should be added as an
expense. This popup window will have a 'Yes' and 'No' button.

3. If the user presses the 'Yes' button, the original command that the user inputted to add this particular event is fetched
and passed to the `execute` method of `LogicManager`, which executes command line inputs. Since the timestamp within this
original command now denotes a past or present date, an expense will be added.

4. If the user presses the 'No' button, the expense is not added.

5. After pressing either button, the popup window closes.

NOTE: As of Week 10, adding expenses to the same budget the event was added to is still a work in progress.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What command words should the Events feature use?

* ** Alternative 1:** `addevent`, `deleteevent`, etc.
** Pros: Makes it clear to the user that events are separate from expenses
** Cons: Somewhat clunky and redundant, especially since expenses and events share the same fields

* ** Alternative 2:** `add`, `delete`, etc. (i.e. same command words as adding expenses)
** Pros: More streamlined, makes use of the fact that expenses and events share the same fields
** Cons: The distinction between events and expenses is more blurry to the user

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
Adopt Alternative 2. Since an event is ultimately an optional future expense that triggers on its
due date, it is significantly more intuitive and natural to allow users to add events the same way they add expenses.
MooLah can then easily tell whether the user intends to add an expense or an event by looking at the timestamp
the user inputs in the command.


===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)

Users can set their expenses to recur. Recurring expenses will generate events daily/weekly/monthly (based on
the user's decision) that can then be added as expenses when their due dates are reached.

//end::events[]

// category::stats[]
=== Statistics Feature

The statistics feature is facilitated by the `Statistics` class, which is part of the `model` package.
Its main purpose is to allow users to have an alternative view for the entries in `MooLah`. The
main entries that `Statistics` interacts with are `Expense` and `Budget`, and the metrics chosen to be displayed
are handled mainly by `Statistics#calculateStatistics()`. The method recognises command words such as
`stats`, `statscompare` and `statstrend`, where each results in a different visual representation and represents
a different use case.

The final outcome of these interactions are reflected directly in `MainWindow`, as a popup whenever the command is received
by the command line.

NOTE: Ideally, it should result in an `Undo`-able page-transition instead of a popup to ensure better integration with the rest of the application.

==== `stats`

===== Implementation

The purpose of the `stats` command word is to request `MooLah` to visualise the total expenditure across
expenses of different categories as a percentage of the total expenditure of all expenses tracked under the budget
where the command is called. The visual representation used here will be a PieChart.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `stats` command word is handled by `MooLah`.


Step 1. The user enters the command `stats sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019` to visualise the total percentage of each category
as a percentage of total expenditure across all categories, in the primary budget.
The command is received by `AddressBookParser`, which then creates a `StatsCommandParser` object,
to subsequently help to parse the input by the user.

Step 2. The newly created `StatsCommandParser` calls `parse("stats sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019")`,
which in turns calls `ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize("sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019", PREFIX_START_DATE, PREFIX_END_DATE)` to
split the arguments into its preamble(the start date and end date). This returns an `ArgumentMultimap` object, `argMultimap` containing the split input.

Step 3. The `StatsCommandParser` object calls `ParserUtil.parseTimestamp(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_START_DATE).get())` which parses the arguments to get the start date.
The date, that is present in this example, is parsed into the correct form and the end date is obtained similarly with
`ParserUtil.parseTimestamp(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_END_DATE).get())`.
A `StatsCommand` object containing the start date and end date is created and returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 4. The LogicManager calls `StatsCommand.execute()`, which calls `Model#getFilteredExpenseList()` to retrieve the list of expenses stored in MooLah.
The correct `Statistics` object, `statistics`, will be created with `startStatistic` and the `calculateStats` method, will switch to the correct mode,
to produce the correct feedback to the user, as well as update the attributes in `statistics`.

Step 5. Percentages, categories and the title description of the `Statistics` will be used to create the `CommandResult` object,
which is returned to the `LogicManager` and subsequently to the UI where a popup in the form of a pie chart will be generated.


The following sequence diagram shows how the `stats` operation works:

image::BasicStatisticsCommand.png[]

Figure 1. Sequence Diagram for executing a `StatsCommand`


The following reference diagram shows how `StatsCommandParser` decides on the user's start date and end date for the different cases.
This is used mainly to illustrate the interactions in Steps 2 to 3.

image::StatsCommandParser.png[]

Figure 2. Reference Diagram for deciding start date and end date for a `StatsCommand`


NOTE: As of Week 10, the design of `StatsCommand.execute()` in Step 4 is still a work in progress because of concurrent refactoring, developing command words
and other dependencies due to outdated methods that causes a depreciated return type to still be in use. This should be resolved ideally by v1.3.


==== Design Considerations

When designing the interaction of `Statistics#calculateStatistics()` with `stats`, decisions have to be made on the most
suitable visual representation for `stats` particular use case.

* ** Alternative 1:** Table view
** Pros: Sequential view, can capture number of entries
** Cons: May be a duplicate of the `ListExpense` command, just sorted via categories

* ** Alternative 2:** Pie chart
** Pros: Offers a visual view of size to represent the expenditure under each category
** Cons: Loses the elements of number of entries in each category

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
Adopts Alternative 2. It is important that every aspect of the user experience gets covered, and what `MooLah` before the
inclusion of `Statistics` is the appreciation of percentage expenditure in each category of expenses. Expenses can already be
observed in its chronological order using `ListExpense` while individual view of expenses under a category can be accessed
using `FindExpense`. Offering a visual view on expenditure under each category complements with the existing implementation
of sequential view in the primary budget.

NOTE: Once again, this question will be better addressed holistically once all 3 features has been rolled out.

===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)

For each of the command words, users will be given the option to choose a Visual Representation method they prefer,
instead of the default option we have prioritised. Currently, statistics under `stats` mode can only be displayed in a pie chart,
and users may have different preferences for formats. Various options such as checking across different budgets other than within the same budget can also be considered.


// end::stats[]


// category::Alias[]
=== Alias feature
==== Implementation
The Aliases feature allows users to assign inputs they may use very often to a shortcut, and execute the input by entering
the shortcut, (a.k.a ``Alias``), in place of the full or partial command.

image::AliasMappingsClassDiagram.png[AliasMappingsClassDiagram]

These user defined ``Alias``es are saved in an ``AliasMappings`` object within ``UserPref`` as seen in the above diagram.
Internally, the ``AliasMappings`` object stores an ``Alias`` in a Map<Strings, Alias> object. With the addition of `AliasMappings` object to ``UserPref``,
``UserPref`` supports these additional operations:

- ``UserPref#addUserAlias(Alias)`` -- Saves a specified `Alias` to the user preferences for future use.
- ``UserPref#hasAlias(String)`` -- Query if the there is an `Alias` with this name already defined.
- ``UserPref#getAlias(String)`` -- To get an `Alias` with this name if it exists.
- ``UserPref#aliasNameIsReservedCommandWord(Alias)`` -- To query if this `Alias` is uses a name which clashes with existing built-in
commands.
- ``UserPref#aliasCommandWordIsAlias(Alias)`` -- To query if this `Alias` `input` begins with another `Alias`, this is used
to validate that an `Alias` will not cause an infinite loop by chaining multiple aliases in a loop.
- ``UserPref#getAliasMappings()`` -- To access the ``Alias`` saved by the user.
- ``UserPref#setAliasMappings(AliasMappings mappings)`` -- To overwrite all the `Alias` saved by the user.


image::AliasCommandClassDiagram.png[]

In order for the user to save an ``Alias``, they first define it using the ``AliasCommand``. The ``AliasCommand`` command extends
`UndoableCommand` to allow users to undo defining an `Alias`. The following sequence diagram describe in more detail how an ``Alias``
is added.

image::HighLevelAddAliasSequenceDiagram.png[]
[None]
. 1. The user enters a command with the following syntax `` alias a/ <name> i/ <input>``.
. 2. The `UI` passes this command string to the `LogicManager` which passes it onto the `AddressBookParser`.
. 3. The parser extracts the argument string and passes it to an ``AliasCommandParser``.

image::ParseAliasCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
[None]
. 4. The ``AliasCommandParser`` uses the ``ArgumentTokenizer`` to tokenize the argument string and extract the
``alias name`` and ``input`` fields into an ``ArgumentMultimap``.
. 5. The arguments are obtained and to create a new `Alias` using the the `Alias` parser in `ParserUtil`.
. 6. An `AliasCommand` is created containing this new `Alias` to add to the `UserPref`.
. 7. This is passed back to the `LogicManager` to call `AliasCommand#run()`.

image::verifyAlias.png[]
[None]
. 8. The `AliasCommand` is validated using `AliasCommand#validate()`. The `Alias` is checked to ensure it does not
[None]
    ** a. Have a clashing name used by an existing `Command` as a CommandWord.
    ** b. Have an input beginning with a supported `Alias`.
. If is not valid, handled exception is thrown.

image::addAlias.png[]
[None]
. 9. If it was validated that the `Alias` can be added.
. 10. The `Alias` is then added to the `AliasMappings` object within `UserPref`.
. 11. The `Alias` is now usable  by the user.


When a user enters an ``input`` to be executed, the ``AddressBookParser`` will first try to parse first token in
the ``input`` as a ``CommandWord``, failing which, it will try to parse it as an ``Alias``. If it successfully does so,
it replaces the first token in the original command string with the ``input`` stored in the ``Alias``.
Finally, the ``AddressBookParser`` re-parses the modified ``input``.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Why can an `Alias` only be used at the beginning of an input versus anywhere within an input.
* ** Alternative 1(Chosen):** Beginning only
** Pros: Easier to determine which word is the shortcut.
** Pros: Easier to detect recursion due to alias chaining.
** Cons: Less flexible in term how the shortcut can be used i.e. it can only replace or prefix an input.

* ** Alternative 2:** Anywhere in input
** Pros: A wider variety of shortcuts can be defined by the user +
e.g. `add deckChicken 2.50`, where `deckChicken` maps to `d/ chicken rice c/ food p/`.
** Cons: Harder to detect recursion due to alias chaining.
** Cons: Parsing becomes more complicated and alias words become unusable in other contexts.
e.g. defining an `Alias` mapping `bus` to `sbs bus` prevents an input such as `smrt bus` from being parsed properly
as it would be replaced with `smrt sbs bus` by the parser.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
The biggest factor in choosing `Alternative 1` is to make it easier to prevent possible recusion due to alias chaining,
which would potentially be a fatal bug in the application.
Additionally, while it may be possible to determine which one the user means judging by the context in which it was used.
However, that is far out of the scope of the module and would require much more processing of user input.

Another alternative would have been to have an alias name follow the following convention `'aliasName'` (i.e. some character before and after)
clear what is an `Alias` within an input.

===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)
The purpose behind this feature was to make CLI input less troublesome, so users do not need to type in the full input string
to carry out commands they may use frequently. In v2.0 we want to look into using data analysis track users' input habits in
order to make suggestions on possible shortcuts or Aliases they may find convenient to have.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store Aliases.

* ** Alternative 1:** List
** Pros: Less space needed to store same amount of data
** Cons: Takes time to loop through the list to get the right output.

* ** Alternative 2(Chosen):** Map
** Pros: Simple to access
** Cons: More space needed.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
As the user can define multiple aliases, it was important for the internal structure of `AliasMappings`
to allow accessing the aliases by name.

If an ArrayList was used, the numbering each alias would change if new ones were added and old one removed or replaced.
Map was used to prevent this problem as the name is used as the index. This avoids the need to loop through
all the 'Alias' defined.

It also makes it easier to prevent sharing of alias names between aliases and a Map's key
set cannot contain duplicates, and makes it easier to handle overwriting of existing aliases with same name.

=== Syntax Highlighting and Autofill feature
==== Implementation
The Autofill feature was implemented to make it less important for users to remember the appropriate syntax for each command which
can be a common issue in CLI based applications. This feature utilises regular expressions and JavaFX's TextFormatter to extend the
functionality of the existing TextField used in the original AB3 application.

The Autofill feature also inserts `placeholders` into the text area to make it clearer which arguments each prefix delimit in the input.
e.g. `add d/ <description> p/ <price> c/ <category>`. These `placeholder` are removed when the user types over them and
are filtered from the input and not parsed by the `Parser` if the user forgets to type over them. The following diagram briefly describe
the logic used to insert auto fill a command's syntax.

::image:AutoFillActivityDiagram.png[]

The Syntax highlighting feature was implemented to make it easier to differentiate the different arguments after typing
as well as to implement some basic realtime input validation. This feature utilises RichTextFX's StyleClassTextArea to
apply different styles to different regions of the text, and regular expressions to determine which to highlight.

::image:SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram.png[]

Because RichTextFX's TextAreas do not support JavaFX's TextFormatter, the `SyntaxHighlightingTextArea` actually has two different
TextAreas. One as the visible TestArea (RichTextFX) and one as the functional one (JavaFX).

::image:SyntaxHighlightingTextAreaClassDiagram.png[]

The two TextArea are layered on top of each other. The invisible functional TextArea overlays the visible one, and mirrors the TextProperty of the
visible one mirrors the functional TextArea. The KeyEvents which occur in the functional text area are also mirrored by the visible text area.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Which configuration of Input fields to use? - RichTextFX TextArea alone, JavaFX alone, both together?
* ** Alternative 1:**  JavaFX alone (JavaFX `TextField`) and manually place coloured elements to handle highlighting.
** Pros: Already supports single line input.
** Pros: Easy to implement autofill.
** Cons: Does not inherently support styling of text with multiple styles.
** Cons: Manually inserting worked, but not all the time.

* ** Alternative 2:** `RichTextFX StyleClassTextArea` and ``Listener``s to handle formatting of text.
** Pros: Supports styling of text.
** Cons: Needs have certain `Events` blocked and functionality removed in order to act as a single line input field. e.g.
preventing users from pasting text with newlines and the enter key event from making a new line.
** Cons: Does not support javafx `TextFormatter`, intermediate results (unwanted text) can possibly be evaluated.

* ** Alternative 3(Chosen):** Both
** Pros: Utilise best of both worlds, with `TextFormatter` and `RichTextFX StyleClassTextArea`
** Cons: Need to properly align the two text areas so visible text and caret position is accurate.
** Cons: Needs have certain `Events` blocked and functionality removed in order to act as a single line input field. e.g.
preventing users from pasting text with newlines and the enter key event from making a new line.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
With alternative 1, using a `TextFlow` was a problem when the text needed to remain in
a single line. Manually layering coloured elements over the text was also an issue as the the position and size of elements
eeded to be recalculated every time the text change, the UI moved, or was resized.

While it was possible to use RichTextFX text areas alone, the text that the user inputs before it is formatted
still enters the text area. Which interferes with realtime parsing as the text is not properly sanitized, which was
why the uses `TextFormatter` was necessary.

This meant only alternative 3 was viable, but because of layer of the two text areas, the events causing a change in text
or what text was visible needed to be properly mirrored from the invisible to the visible text area. As a result, certain behaviours
supported by a normal textfield needed to be blocked to ensure proper alignment e.g. copy and paste.

At the moment, mass deletion and selection of text (e.g. Ctrl/Cmd+A > Backspace) has been prevented in order to properly align the
two textarea.

===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)
MooLah v2.0 should support better real time parsing of input and support validation of input without requiring the user
to enter the command as well as a more functional input field.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
