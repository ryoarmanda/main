== Introduction



MooLah is a hassle-free expense tracker for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expenses*.
More importantly, MooLah is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). MooLah supports user-friendly input formats and
aliases that greatly improves the efficiency of CLI operations. It also has a robust statistics feature and supports
the addition of both expenses and events into budgets of your choosing.
If you can type fast, MooLah can get your expense management tasks done much faster than traditional GUI expense
trackers.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `MooLah-v1.3.2.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for `MooLah`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Make sure the window is not in fullscreen and there is some space below the textfield in order
for the autocomplete popup to show properly.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listexpense`* : lists all expenses
* *`addexpense d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food t/25-10`* : adds an expense named `Chicken Rice` to the expense tracker.
* *`deleteexpense 3`* : deletes the 3rd expense shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in between `<` and `>` are the parameters which are to be supplied by you! +
  e.g. `add p/<PRICE>`, you will need to supply a value to be used as the `PRICE` such as `add p/2.50` .
* You don't have to input the parameters in square brackets if you don't want to. These arguments are optional, and you
may use them to specify more details.
** `addexpense d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<PRICE> c/<CATEGORY> [t/<DATE>]` means that both +
`addexpense d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food` and +
`addexpense d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food t/25-01` +
are valid inputs


* You may also enter parameters which have a prefix in any order.
** `addexpense p/2.50 d/chicken rice c/food` +
 `addexpense c/food d/chicken rice p/2.50` are both valid.
* However, for commands which require an argument without a prefix require that the argument be supplied immediately after the command word.
** `editexpense 1 p/2.30` is valid.
** `editexpense d/2.30 1` is not valid.

====


=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::undo[]
=== Undo/Redo
==== Undo the previous command : `undo`

Did something wrong? You can undo it.

However, do keep in mind that you can only undo commands that modify the data in MooLah, such as `addexpense`, `deleteexpense`, and so on.
Head over to <<Command Summary>> for list of commands that are undoable.

Do not worry if you forgot what you did a few steps back (it happens!). MooLah will display a short description of what
particular command it undid to help you confirm that you undid the right thing.

Format: `undo`

Example:
```
deleteexpense 5
undo
```
Result:
The deletion of expense #5 will be undone, or in other words, re-added to MooLah.
MooLah will then display the message `Undid "Delete expense with index 5"`.

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]
==== Redo an undone command : `redo`

You might hit one undo too many and wish to cancel that one undo. That's okay, redo will help you on that.

Similar to undo, MooLah will display a short description of the command it redid to you.

Format: `redo`

Example:
```
deleteexpense 5
undo
redo
```
Result:
At the end, expense #5 will keep being deleted (poor thing!). MooLah will also display a message `Redid "Delete expense with index 5"`.

// end::redo[]

=== Changing panels: `view`
While most commands will change the panel-in-view to the relevant panel, you may wish to manually go to a panel without
attempting to modify data. You may do so with the `view` command.

The format:
----
view <PANEL_NAME>
----
For example, you may execute the following command to view your Budget List:
----
view Budget List
----
****
These are the panels which you may access through the `view` command: +
- `Aliases` +
- `Expense List` +
- `Primary Budget` +
- `Event List` +
- `Budget List` +
- `Statistics` (see Note below!)
****

****
*Note*

1. Panel names are case-sensitive.

2. Statistics panel is not viewable until statistics have been generated.
----
view Statistics
----

----
stats
listexpenses
view Statistics
----
****


=== Generic commands
MooLah has 5 generic commands which behave differently depending on which Panel in the UI is being shown at the moment.
These commands are `add`, `list`, `clear`, `delete`, and `edit`. These generic commands differ from Panel to Panel.

For example, you are in the Expense List Panel, then the following command:
----
add d/chicken duck p/3 c/food
----
will be interpreted as:
----
addexpense d/chicken duck p/3 c/food
----

=== Natural language DateTime parsing
DateTime formats accepted are handled mostly by a third-party Natural Language Parser library, Natty, which supports human jargon.
Please refer to http://natty.joestelmach.com/ for documentation and more information.
[NOTE]
Natty naturally parses all datetime formats in the American format (e.g. MM/dd, MM-dd).
In MooLah however, we have modified the parser such that all formats are parsed in the international format (e.g. dd/MM).

=== Basic Expense-related Commands
==== Adding an expense: `addexpense`

This is MooLah's fundamental feature: you can add your expenses.

This is the format:
----
addexpense d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<PRICE> c/<CATEGORY> [t/TIMESTAMP]
----

****
* If you don't specify the time, your expense will be added with its time being the current system time.
* You should only input one of the following into the CATEGORY field: `FOOD`, `TRAVEL`, `TRANSPORT`,
`SHOPPING`, `UTILITIES`, `HEALTHCARE`, `ENTERTAINMENT`, `EDUCATION`, `OTHERS`.
These categories are case-insensitive.
****
Examples:

* `addexpense d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Shopping t/10-10`
* `addexpense d/Buffet c/Food p/250`
* `addexpense d/Chicken rice p/2.50 c/Food t/yesterday noon`

==== Listing all expenses : `listexpenses`

You can list every single expense you have added into MooLah.

Format: `listexpenses`

==== Updating an expense: `editexpense`

Made a mistake? You can edit expenses too.

Format:
----
editexpense <INDEX> [p/<PRICE>] [d/<DESCRIPTION>] [t/<TIMESTAMP>] [c/<CATEGORY>]
----
Example:
----
editexpense 2 p/3.50
----
This will update the price of the 2nd expense in the current list to 3.50.


****
* Edits the expense at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

==== Locating expenses by name: `find`

You can find expenses whose description contains any of the keywords you inputted.

Format:
----
findexpense <KEYWORD> [<MORE_KEYWORDS>]
----

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `chicken` will match `Chicken`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Puff Curry` will match `Curry Puff`
* Only the description is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `chick` will not match `chicken`
* Expenses matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. an expense with description
`Chicken rice`, and expense with description `Duck Rice` will both match `rice`
****

Examples:

* `findexpense rice` will show you all expenses with rice in their description.

* `findexpense chicken taxi schoolfee` will show you all expenses with either `chicken`, `taxi`, `schoolfee`, or a
combination of those in their description.

==== Deleting an expense: `deleteexpense`

You can also delete an expense from the expenses list in MooLah.

Format:
----
deleteexpense <INDEX>
----
****
* Deletes the expense at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

----
listexpenses
delete 2
----
Deletes the 2nd expense in the list of expenses, shown after `listexpenses` is executed.

----
listexpenses
findexpense chicken
deleteexpense 1
----
Deletes the 1st expense in the results of the `findexpense` command.

=== Basic Event-related Commands

Events are pretty similar to expenses, except that they denote potential expenses that they may happen in the future.
You should use this feature to keep track of future important events in your life that would require you to spend some money
(e.g. your friends' birthdays).

At launch, MooLah will remind you of your upcoming events. Any transpired events would also appear as popups,
asking you whether you wish to add these events as corresponding expenses.

image::TranspiredEventsPopup.png[width="790"]

==== Adding an event: `addevent`

Events share the same fields as expenses, so you add them the same way.

Format:
----
addevent d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<PRICE> c/<CATEGORY> t/<TIMESTAMP>
----
****
* Events are potential future expenses, so the `TIMESTAMP` field is compulsory and should contain a future time.
* You should only input one of the following into the `CATEGORY` field:
`FOOD`, `TRAVEL`, `TRANSPORT`, `SHOPPING`, `UTILITIES`, `HEALTHCARE`, `ENTERTAINMENT`, `EDUCATION`, `OTHERS`.
These categories are case-insensitive.
****
Examples:

* `addevent d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Shopping t/two weeks from now`
* `addevent d/Family buffet c/Food p/250 t/31-12`
* `addevent d/Bangkok plane tickets t/tomorrow p/200 c/Travel`

==== Listing all events : `listevents`

You can list every single event you have added into MooLah.

Format:
----
listevents
----
==== Updating an event: `editevent`

You can edit events the same way you edit expenses.

Format:
----
editevent <INDEX> [p/<PRICE>] [d/<DESCRIPTION>] [t/<TIMESTAMP>] [c/<CATEGORY>]
----

Example:
----
editevent 2 p/300
----
Updates the price of the 2nd event in the current list to be 300.


****
* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****
==== Deleting an event: `deleteevent`

You can also delete an event from the events list in MooLah.

Format:
----
deleteevent <INDEX>
----

****
* Deletes the event at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

----
listevents
delete 2
----
Deletes the 2nd event in the list of events, shown by `listevents`.

=== Let's Do Budgeting

Feel a need to cut your spending? Try the awesome budgeting feature!
It can help you cultivate better financial management habits in the following ways:

* Each budget has a progress bar with a percentage, which indicates how much you have
spent as a proportion to the limit.
* The color of the progress bar implies the following 4 situations:
- GREEN: Less than half of the limit.
- YELLOW: Spent half of the limit.
- ORANGE: Reached 90% of the limit.
- RED: Exceeded the limit.
* When your expenses reach 90% of the limit, it will give a warning to remind you to
cut down on your spending.
* When your expenses exceed the budget limit, it will give another warning. However,
the percentage will continue to update even if it exceeds 100%, to give you a better idea
of how much you have overspent.

==== Create a new budget : `addbudget`
Want your expenses tracked under a recurring budget? Simple enough with this command: `addbudget`

The concrete format is:
----
addbudget d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<AMOUNT> sd/<START_DATE> pr/<PERIOD>
----

For example, after typing
----
addbudget d/school p/300 sd/01-10-2019 pr/month
----
You'll see that a new budget "school" is created, and set to $300, recurring monthly, starting from 1st October 2019.

Tips:

* 4 types of budget periods are supported, namely `day`, `week`, `month`, and `year` (all in lower case).
* The year in start date is optional, i.e. you can simply input `01-10` and the year will be automatically set
to the current year.
* The start date can be any time in the past or future, the budget period will automatically
normalize to the current period.
For example, if today is `23-10-2019`, when you type `sd/01-07 pr/month`, the resulting budget period
will be `01-10-2019 to 31-10-2019`, since that's the period anchored by today's date.
* All budgets are recurring. Continuing from the example above, at 1 Nov 2019, you'll see the budget's period refreshed
to `01-11-2019 to 30-11-2019`, and all past expenses archived, giving you an empty budget panel to start with.

==== Switch between budgets : `switchbudget`
Now that you've successfully added a few different budgets, wonder how to toggle between them? Try this magical command:
`switchbudget`, which switches the primary budget to any other budget in one shot!

The concrete format is:
----
switchbudget d/<BUDGET_NAME>`
----

For example, suppose you're at primary budget `school` now.

After typing:
----
switchbudget d/outside school
----

You will see that the primary budget panel is switched from `school` to `outside school`. Every expense you add
from now on will be tracked under the "outside school" budget instead.

==== List all budgets: `listbudgets`
To get an overview of all the budgets at hand, simply type:

----
listbudgets
----
You'll see a list of all budgets in MooLah.

Tips:

* The primary budget is marked with a red border.
* To go back to primary budget panel, type `view Primary Budget`.

==== Edit a budget: `editbudget`
A typo? On a second thought? No worries, you can easily modify your budget with `editbudget`.

The concrete format is:
----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
editbudget <INDEX> d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<AMOUNT> sd/<START DATE> pr/<PERIOD>
----

For example, if the second budget shown in the list is "school", recurring monthly, amount set at $300,
refreshed on the first day of each month, after typing:

----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
editbudget 2 d/school expenses p/400 sd/05-10
----

It will change to "school expenses", capped at $400, refreshed on the 5th of every month.

Tips:

* You can choose to edit any of these 4 attributes of a budget: `DESCRIPTION`, `AMOUNT`, `START DATE`
and `PERIOD`, more than one at a time.

==== Delete a budget (by name) : `deletebudget`
Don't want it any more? Use `deletebudget` to say bye to your budget!

The concrete format is:
----
deletebudget d/<BUDGET_NAME>
----

For example, after typing:

----
deletebudget d/school
----

The budget with the name "school" will be deleted.

==== Delete a budget (by index) : `deletebudgetid`
If budget names are too long, there's an easier way to delete them: `deletebudgetid`.

The concrete format is:
----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
deletebudget <INDEX>
----
You'll see the corresponding budget disappear from the list.

Tips:

* Regretted? Type `undo` to get it back ;D

==== Delete all budgets: `clearbudgets`
Don't feel like living on budgets any more? You can clear them all, just by a simple command:
`clearbudgets`.

Tips:

* The Default Budget cannot be deleted or modified. It holds all expenses without a proper budget defined by you.
* For testers: delete /data folder, and restart MooLah, to get it populated with sample expenses and budgets
again for further testing.

==== View expenses in a different period: `switchperiod`
Wanna see your archived expenses in the past? The command `switchperiod` is the time machine you need.

The concrete format is:
----
switchperiod t/<DATE>
----

For example, suppose you have a monthly budget "school", refreshed at the first day of each month; and
suppose it is November now.
After typing:
----
switchperiod t/01-05
----
You'll see all expenses tracked under "school" from 1 May to 31 May this year.

Tips:

* The time machine can only travel *back* in time! That is, if the date is in the current or future period, you'll need
to input again.
* Only expenses tracked under *the current budget* are shown.

// tag::brian[]

=== Making inputs quick and easy.

==== Creating a shortcut:  `alias`
You can save your favourite inputs by assigning them to an `alias`.

The format is:
------
addalias a/<ALIAS_NAME> i/<INPUT>
------
For example, you can type:
----
addalias a/chicken i/ addexpense d/ Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food
----
This creates an alias `chicken` for `addexpense d/ Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food` which when executed creates: +
an `Expense` with `price=2.50` and `description=“Chicken Rice”` in the `Food category`.

You may also create an alias with an incomplete input which you may add arguments to when using it:
----
addalias a/ addfood i/ addexpense c/Food
addfood d/ chickenrice p/3.50
----

****
*Note*

* Alias names cannot contain white spaces.
* Alias names cannot be the name of another alias.
* You may not create an alias that creates an alias.
* Using the same name for an alias will overwrite the existing alias if it exists.
****

****
*Warning*  +
Because MooLah prioritizes later instances of a prefix, including `a/` and `i/` in your input may cause your Alias to
not be parsed properly.
****
==== Listing the shortcuts you have saved: `listaliases`
To view the aliases you have defined, you may use the `listaliases`.

Alternatively, you may use the `view` command by typing `view Aliases`.

Either of these will bring you to the `User Defined Aliases` panel where
you can see the list of aliases you have created.

==== Deleting the shortcuts you no longer want to use: `deletealias`
To delete an `Alias` you no longer wish to use, you may use the `deletealias` command.

This is the format:
----
deletealias <ALIAS_NAME>
----
This will delete the `Alias` with the name you specified. For example:
----
addalias a/hello i/helloworld
deletealias hello
----
This will delete the `hello` from your saved shortcuts.

==== Autocomplete
When entering a command, MooLah will show you a list of valid command words which match the text you have entered.
****
image:autocommand0.png[width="350px"] +
You can press kbd:[TAB] to cycle through the available suggestions and press kbd:[ENTER] to autocomplete.
All other keys will hide the menu.
****

When you have entered a valid command, MooLah will show you a list of prefixes you have missed while typing your input.
Prefixes with the red `Missing` tag are required prefixes you have not entered. While orange `Optional`
prefixes are not necessary.

****
image:autoprefix0.png[width="350px"] +
You can press kbd:[TAB] to cycle through the available suggestions and press kbd:[ENTER] to autocomplete.
All other keys will hide the menu.
****

****
image:autoprefix1.png[width="350px"] +
After including the prefix, the prefix will not be included in the menu.
****

If you choose `ALL MISSING`, all your missing required prefixes will be inserted.


==== Syntax Highlighting
****
image:syntaxhighlighting0.png[width="350px"] +
argument and prefix highlighting
****
MooLah highlights valid prefixes, and indicates what arguments fall under them.

*note*: while an argument may be highlighted, it does mean the value is valid.

****
image:descriptionplaceholder.png[width="350px"] +
`<placeholder>` for description field
****
After typing in a prefix, MooLah will put a `<placeholder>` to remind you what the argument you should
enter is. +
Typing over this area will write write over the placeholder.

****
image:amountplaceholder.png[width="350px"] +
`<placeholder>` for amount field
****

*note* +
If you forget to type over the placeholders, do not worry. It will not affect your input as these placeholders are
ignored during execution of your input.

==== Input history
You may cycle through successfully entered commands during the current session with the kbd:[UP] and kbd:[DOWN] keys.

For example, if you entered these commands previously.
----
addexpense d/chickenrice p/12.3 c/food
addexpense d/chickenrice p/12.3 c/food
addexpense d/duck rice p/12.3111 c/food
----
You may cycle through these commands using the arrow keys.

// end::brian[]

=== Saving the data
Expense tracker data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

// tag::statsug[]

=== Viewing Statistics
==== Summary Statistics: `stats`
This command allows you to have a basic summary of the money spent from their
categorical expenses in a given period of their current budget.

The visual output of the statistics shown is a pie chart, with each piece representing
the combined expenditure of all expenses under the category,
taken as a percentage of the total expenditure in the budget the command was called.


Format: `stats [sd/<START_DATE>] [ed/<END_DATE>]`


[NOTE]

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- Categories where no tracked expenses fall under will not be reflected in the Statistics Panel.


[TIP]
- There is no need to specify all the parameters if the outcomes of the example usage scenarios
below fit your needs

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, the period of the current budget will be considered as
the unit of time and statistics is calculated till one unit of time after `START_DATE`.

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, the period of the current budget will be considered as
the unit of time and statistics is calculated starting from one unit of time before `END_DATE`.

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, statistics will be calculated using the start date and end date
of the current window of the budget.

Example of configurations:
`stats`
`stats sd/ytd`
`stats sd/11-11-2018 ed/12-12-2018`

Step-by-step guide:
For example, MooLah is currently at the "school" budget with these expenses in window 1
(sd1 to ed1) and window2(sd2 to ed2)

To generate the pie chart:

. Type `stats` into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message Pie Chart generated.
. The screen will be switched into the Statistics Panel where the Pie Chart will be generated.
+








==== Comparison Statistics: `statscompare`


This command allows you to have a side-to-side comparison
of the money spent from their categorical expenses in
2 periods of their current budget. In this comparison, we provide
you with data of both the similarities and differences in these 2
periods.

The visual output of the statistics shown is a table view,
with 5 columns, consisting of a category column, and 2 pairs of
frequency-total expenditure columns. The cells in the first pair
of columns, denoted as "similarity columns" represents the frequency and
total expenditure in any existing overlapping interval between the 2 periods,
while the cells in the second pair of columns, denoted as the "difference columns"
represents the difference in frequency and difference in total expenditure.


Format: `statscompare sd1/<START_DATE_1> sd2/<START_DATE_2> [pr/<PERIOD>]`

[NOTE]
- Date formats accepted are handled by our Natural Language Parser library which supports human jargons.
Please refer to the above documentation for more information.

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- `PERIOD` takes in either of the following keywords: week, month, year

- The cells in the "similarity columns" denote only non-negative values. This is because it
shows the frequency and total expenditure common to both periods.

- The cells in the "difference columns" may contain negative values. This is because
the values for differences in frequency and differences in total expenditure for each category
is calculated using the formula `second period – first period`.

`[Coming in v2.0]`
- day is ideally recognised as a keyword to `PERIOD`
- constructing periods with start dates doesn't align with the principles of the application
as compared to end dates.



[TIP]
- There is no need to specify all the parameters if the outcomes of the example usage scenarios
below fit your needs

- If `PERIOD` is empty, the period of the current budget will be considered as
the unit of time to construct the 2 periods to be compared.

- If zeroes are observed in the similarity columns, it may be possible that there is no
overlap between the 2 periods or there are no expenses recorded in the common period.

- It is possible to reorder the columns generated after the Table is being generated for better
comparison.

Example of configurations:
`statscompare sd1/12-12 sd2/ 1 month ago'
`stats sd2/ today sd1/ytd pr/ week`
`stats sd2/ 23-09-2019 sd1/1 year ago  pr/ month`


Step-by-step guide:
For example, MooLah is currently at the "school" budget with these expenses in window 1
(sd1 to ed1) and window2(sd2 to ed2)

To generate the table view:

. Type `statscompare sd1/12-12 sd2/ 1 month ago' into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message Table generated.
. The screen will be switched into the Statistics Panel where the Table View will be generated.

==== Growth Statistics : `statstrend`

This command allows you to see the growth
of the money spent from their categorical expenses in specified
units of time between the period specified in the current budget.

The visual output of the statistics shown is in the form of plotted
trend lines, one for each category and every plotted point on a line
represents the total expenditure starting from its stated date,
till before the start of the next date.

Format: `statstrend [sd/<START_DATE>] [ed/<END_DATE>] mode/MODE`


[NOTE]
- Date formats accepted are handled by our Natural Language Parser library which supports human jargons.
Please refer to the above documentation for more information.

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- We only allow a maximum of 34 plotted points to be displayed, which means that in any specified
time interval bounded by the start date and end date, we will produce at most 34 time intervals of
the specified unit of time starting from the start date.

- The categories that do not have any expenses in any of the time intervals will not be reflected
as trend lines in the Statistics Panel.




[TIP]
- There is no need to specify all the parameters if the outcomes of the example usage scenarios
below fit your needs

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, statistics is calculated till 34 unit of time after `START_DATE`.

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, the statistics is calculated starting from
34 units of time before `END_DATE`.

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, statistics will be calculated 17 units of time before the current date
till 17 units of time after the current date.

- The unit interval of time is set to always be the period of the current budget,
