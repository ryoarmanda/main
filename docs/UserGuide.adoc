== Introduction



MooLah is a hassle-free expense tracker for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expenses*.
More importantly, MooLah is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). MooLah supports user-friendly input format and
aliases that greatly improves the efficiency of CLI operations. It also supports recurring expenses and includes menus
from canteens of National University of Singapore for students to track their everyday food expenses in a second.
If you can type fast, MooLah can get your expense management tasks done much faster than traditional GUI expense
trackers.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `moolah_v1.3.0.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for `MooLah`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all expenses
* **`add`**`d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food t/25-10` : adds an expense named `Chicken Rice` to the expense tracker.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd expense shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by you!
  e.g. in `add p/PRICE`, `PRICE` is a parameter which can be used as `add p/2.50`
* You don't have to input the parameters in square brackets if you don't want to; they are optional.
** `d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE c/CATEGORY [t/DATE]` can be used as `add d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food` or
`add d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food t/25-01`

* You can input parameters in any order.
** `add p/PRICE d/DESCRIPTION`, `add d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE` are both acceptable.
====


=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::undo[]
=== Undo the previous command : `undo`

Did something wrong? You can undo it. However, do keep in mind that you can only undo commands that modify the data in MooLah, such as `addexpense`, `deleteexpense`, and so on.

Do not worry if you forget what did you do a few steps back (it happens!), MooLah will display a short description of what
particular command it did undo to ensure that you undo the right thing.

Format: `undo`

Example:
```
deleteexpense 5
undo
```
Result:
The deletion of expense #5 will be undone, or in other words, re-added to MooLah.
MooLah will then display the message `Undid "Delete expense with index 5"`.

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]
=== Redo an undone command : `redo`

You might hit one undo too many and you wish to cancel that one undo. That's okay, redo will help you on that.

Similar to undo, MooLah will display a short description of the command it did redo to you.

Format: `redo`

Example:
```
deleteexpense 5
undo
redo
```
Result:
At the end, expense #5 will keep being deleted (poor thing!). MooLah will also display a message `Redid "Delete expense with index 5"`.

// end::redo[]

=== Basic Expense-related Commands
==== Adding an expense: `addexpense`

This is MooLah's fundamental feature: you can add your expenses.

Format: `addexpense d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE c/CATEGORY [t/TIMESTAMP]`

****
* If you don't specify the time, your expense will be added with its time being the current system time.
* You should only input one of the following into the CATEGORY field: FOOD, TRAVEL, TRANSPORT, SHOPPING, UTILITIES, HEALTHCARE, ENTERTAINMENT, EDUCATION, OTHERS.
These categories are case-insensitive.
****
Examples:

* `addexpense d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Shopping t/10-10`
* `addexpense d/Buffet c/Food p/250`
* `addexpense d/Chicken rice p/2.50 c/Food t/yesterday noon`

==== Listing all expenses : `listexpenses`

You can list every single expense you have added into MooLah.

Format: `listexpenses`

==== Updating an expense: `editexpense`

Made a mistake? You can edit expenses too.

Format: `edit INDEX [p/PRICE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TIMESTAMP] [c/CATEGORY]...`

Example:

`edit 2 p/3.50`
Updates the price of the 2nd expense in the current list to 3.50.


****
* Edits the expense at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* You can set the time of the expense to the system’s current time by typing `t/` without specifying a time.
****

==== Locating expenses by name: `find`

You can find expenses whose description contains any of the keywords you inputted.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `chicken` will match `Chicken`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Puff Curry` will match `Curry Puff`
* Only the description is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `chick` will not match `chicken`
* Expenses matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. an expense with description
`Chicken rice`, and expense with description `Duck Rice` will both match `rice`
****

Examples:

* `find rice` returns `chicken rice` and `duck rice`.
* `find chicken taxi schoolfee` returns any expense having description containing `chicken`, `taxi`, or `schoolfee`.

==== Deleting an expense: `deleteexpense`

You can also delete an expense from the expenses list in MooLah.

Format: `deleteexpense INDEX`

****
* Deletes the expense at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

```
listexpenses
delete 2
```
Deletes the 2nd expense in the list of expenses, shown by `list`.

```
list
find chicken
delete 1
```
Deletes the 1st expense in the results of the `find` command.

=== Basic Event-related Commands

Events are pretty similar to expenses, except that they denote potential expenses that they may happen in the future.
You should use this feature to keep track of future important events in your life that would require you to spend some money
(e.g. your friends' birthdays).

At launch, MooLah will remind you of your upcoming events. Any transpired events would also appear as popups,
asking you whether you wish to add these events as corresponding expenses.

image::TranspiredEventsPopup.png[width="790"]

==== Adding an event: `addevent`

Events share the same fields as expenses, so you add them the same way.

Format: `addevent d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE c/CATEGORY t/TIMESTAMP`

****
* Events are potential future expenses, so the `TIMESTAMP' field is compulsory and should contain a future time.
* You should only input one of the following into the CATEGORY field: FOOD, TRAVEL, TRANSPORT, SHOPPING, UTILITIES, HEALTHCARE, ENTERTAINMENT, EDUCATION, OTHERS.
These categories are case-insensitive.
****
Examples:

* `addevent d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Shopping t/two weeks from now`
* `addevent d/Family buffet c/Food p/250 t/31-12`
* `addevent d/Bangkok plane tickets t/tomorrow p/200 c/Travel`

==== Listing all events : `listevents`

You can list every single event you have added into MooLah.

Format: `listevents`

==== Updating an event: `editevent`

You can edit events the same way you edit expenses.

Format: `edit INDEX [p/PRICE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TIMESTAMP] [c/CATEGORY]...`

Example:

`editevent 2 p/300`
Updates the price of the 2nd event in the current list to 300.


****
* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****
==== Deleting an event: `deleteevent`

You can also delete an event from the events list in MooLah.

Format: `deleteevent INDEX`

****
* Deletes the event at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

```
listevents
delete 2
```
Deletes the 2nd event in the list of events, shown by `listevents`.

==== (Coming in v2.0) Converting any currency to preferred currency : `convert`

=== Let's Do Budgeting

==== Create a new budget : `addbudget`
Want your expenses tracked under a recurring budget? Simple enough with this command: `addbudget`

The concrete format is:
----
addbudget d/DESCRIPTION p/AMOUNT sd/START_DATE pr/PERIOD
----

For example, after typing
----
addbudget d/school p/300 sd/01-10-2019 pr/month
----
You'll see that a new budget "school" is created, and set to $300, recurring monthly, starting from 1st October 2019.

Tips:

* 4 types of budget periods are supported, namely `day`, `week`, `month`, and `year` (all in lower case).
* The year in start date is optional, i.e. you can simply input `01-10` and the year will be automatically set
to the current year.
* The start date can be any time in the past or future, the budget period will automatically
normalize to the current period.
For example, if today is `23-10-2019`, when you type `sd/01-07 pr/month`, the resulting budget period
will be `01-10-2019 to 31-10-2019`, since that's the period anchored by today's date.
* All budgets are recurring. Continuing from the example above, at 1 Nov 2019, you'll see the budget's period refreshed
to `01-11-2019 to 30-11-2019`, and all past expenses archived, giving you an empty budget panel to start with.

==== Switch between budgets : `switchbudget`
Now that you've successfully added a few different budgets, wonder how to toggle between them? Try this magical command:
`switchbudget`, which switches the primary budget to any other budget in one shot!

The concrete format is:
----
switchbudget d/BUDGET_NAME`
----

For example, suppose you're at primary budget `school` now.

After typing:
----
switchbudget d/outside school
----

You will see that the primary budget panel is switched from `school` to `outside school`. Every expense you add
from now on will be tracked under the "outside school" budget instead.

==== List all budgets: `listbudgets`
To get an overview of all the budgets at hand, simply type:

----
listbudgets
----
You'll see a list of all budgets in MooLah.

Tips:

* The primary budget is marked with a red border.
* To go back to primary budget panel, type `view Primary Budget`.

==== Edit a budget: `editbudget`
A typo? On a second thought? No worries, you can easily modify your budget with `editbudget`.

The concrete format is:
----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
editbudget INDEX d/DESCRIPTION p/AMOUNT sd/START DATE pr/PERIOD
----

For example, if the second budget shown in the list is "school", recurring monthly, amount set at $300,
refreshed on the first day of each month, after typing:

----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
editbudget 2 d/school expenses p/400 sd/05-10
----

It will change to "school expenses", capped at $400, refreshed on the 5th of every month.

Tips:

* You can choose to edit any of these 4 attributes of a budget: `DESCRIPTION`, `AMOUNT`, `START DATE`
and `PERIOD`, more than one at a time.

==== Delete a budget: `deletebudget`
Don't want it any more? Use `deletebudget` to say bye to your budget!

The concrete format is:
----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
deletebudget INDEX
----
You'll see the corresponding budget disappear from the list.

Tips:

* Regretted? Type `undo` to get it back ;D

==== View expenses in the past: `pastperiod`
Wanna see your archived expenses in the past? The command `pastperiod` is the time machine you need.

The concrete format is:
----
pastperiod t/DATE
----

For example, suppose you have a monthly budget "school", refreshed at the first day of each month; and
suppose it is November now.
After typing:
----
pastperiod t/01-05
----
You'll see all expenses tracked under "school" from 1 May to 31 May this year.

Tips:

* The time machine can only travel *back* in time! That is, if the date is in the current or future period, you'll need
to input again.
* Only expenses tracked under *this budget* are shown.

=== Creating an alias for your favourite commands : `alias`
Assign a full parameterized input to an alias.

Format: `alias a/ALIAS_NAME c/COMMAND_WITH_PARAMETERS`

E.g.
`alias a/chicken rice c/ add d/ Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food`
Result creates an alias “chicken rice” for the command which adds an expense of 2.50 under the Food category with a
description of “Chicken Rice” at the current system time.

- Note: all white spaces characters will be removed from alias names
- Note: aliases with names of official commands cannot be made
- Note: using the same name for an alias will overwrite the existing alias if it exists

=== Saving the data
Expense tracker data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

// tag::statsug[]

=== Viewing Statistics
==== Summary Statistics: `stats`
This command allows you to have a basic summary of the money spent from their
categorical expenses in a given period of their current budget.

The visual output of the statistics shown is a pie chart, with each piece representing
the combined expenditure of all expenses under the category,
taken as a percentage of the total expenditure in the budget the command was called.


Format: `stats [sd/START_DATE] [ed/END_DATE]`


[NOTE]
- Date formats accepted are handled by our Natural Language Parser library which supports human jargons.
Please refer to the above documentation for more information.

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- Categories where no tracked expenses fall under will not be reflected in the Statistics Panel.


[TIP]
- There is no need to specify all the parameters if the outcomes of the example usage scenarios
below fit your needs

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, the period of the current budget will be considered as
the unit of time and statistics is calculated till one unit of time after `START_DATE`.

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, the period of the current budget will be considered as
the unit of time and statistics is calculated starting from one unit of time before `END_DATE`.

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, statistics will be calculated using the start date and end date
of the current window of the budget.

Example of configurations:
`stats`
`stats sd/ytd`
`stats sd/11-11-2018 ed/12-12-2018`

Step-by-step guide:
For example, MooLah is currently at the "school" budget with these expenses in window 1
(sd1 to ed1) and window2(sd2 to ed2)

To generate the pie chart:

. Type `stats ed/XXX` into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
. The result box will display the message Pie Chart generated.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
. The screen will be switched into the Statistics Panel where the Pie Chart will be generated.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+








==== Comparison Statistics: `statscompare`


This command allows you to have a side-to-side comparison
of the money spent from their categorical expenses in
2 periods of their current budget. In this comparison, we provide
you with data of both the similarities and differences in these 2
periods.

The visual output of the statistics shown is a table view,
with 5 columns, consisting of a category column, and 2 pairs of
frequency-total expenditure columns. The cells in the first pair
of columns, denoted as "similarity columns" represents the frequency and
total expenditure in any existing overlapping interval between the 2 periods,
while the cells in the second pair of columns, denoted as the "difference columns"
represents the difference in frequency and difference in total expenditure.


Format: `statscompare sd1/START_DATE_1 sd2/START_DATE_2 [pr/PERIOD]`

[NOTE]
- Date formats accepted are handled by our Natural Language Parser library which supports human jargons.
Please refer to the above documentation for more information.

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- `PERIOD` takes in either of the following keywords: week, month, year

- The cells in the "similarity columns" denote only non-negative values. This is because it
shows the frequency and total expenditure common to both periods.

- The cells in the "difference columns" may contain negative values. This is because
the values for differences in frequency and differences in total expenditure for each category
is calculated using the formula `second period – first period`.

`[Coming in v2.0]`
- day is ideally recognised as a keyword to `PERIOD`
- constructing periods with start dates doesn't align with the principles of the application
as compared to end dates.



[TIP]
- There is no need to specify all the parameters if the outcomes of the example usage scenarios
below fit your needs

- If `PERIOD` is empty, the period of the current budget will be considered as
the unit of time to construct the 2 periods to be compared.

- If zeroes are observed in the similarity columns, it may be possible that there is no
overlap between the 2 periods or there are no expenses recorded in the common period.

- It is possible to reorder the columns generated after the Table is being generated for better
comparison.

Example of configurations:
`statscompare sd1/12-12 sd2/ 1 month ago'
`stats sd2/ today sd1/ytd pr/ week`
`stats sd2/ 23-09-2019 sd1/1 year ago  pr/ month`


Step-by-step guide:
For example, MooLah is currently at the "school" budget with these expenses in window 1
(sd1 to ed1) and window2(sd2 to ed2)

To generate the table view:

. Type `statscompare sd1/ startdate_of_first sd2/ some_date_in_between' into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
. The result box will display the message Table generated.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
. The screen will be switched into the Statistics Panel where the Table View will be generated.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+

==== Growth Statistics : `statstrend`

This command allows you to see the growth
of the money spent from their categorical expenses in specified
units of time between the period specified in the current budget.

The visual output of the statistics shown is in the form of plotted
trend lines, one for each category and every plotted point on a line
represents the total expenditure starting from its stated date,
till before the start of the next date.

Format: `statstrend [sd/START_DATE] [ed/END_DATE] mode/MODE`


[NOTE]
- Date formats accepted are handled by our Natural Language Parser library which supports human jargons.
Please refer to the above documentation for more information.

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- We only allow a maximum of 34 plotted points to be displayed, which means that in any specified
time interval bounded by the start date and end date, we will produce at most 34 time intervals of
the specified unit of time starting from the start date.

- The categories that do not have any expenses in any of the time intervals will not be reflected
as trend lines in the Statistics Panel.




[TIP]
- There is no need to specify all the parameters if the outcomes of the example usage scenarios
below fit your needs

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, statistics is calculated till 34 unit of time after `START_DATE`.

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, the statistics is calculated starting from
34 units of time before `END_DATE`.

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, statistics will be calculated 17 units of time before the current date
till 17 units of time after the current date.

- The unit interval of time is set to always be the period of the current budget,
hence to access other time modes of this command, please edit the budget's period.

`[Coming in v2.0]`
- `mode/budget` of this command is still work in progress. It will run with unintended output.
Hence not written in the UG


Example of configurations:
`statstrend mode/category`
`statstrend sd/ytd mode/category`
`statstrend sd/11-11-2018 ed/12-12-2018 mode/category`



Step-by-step guide:
For example, MooLah is currently at the "school" budget with these expenses in window 1
(sd1 to ed1) and window2(sd2 to ed2)

To generate the table view:

. Type `statstrend mode/category` into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
. The result box will display the message trend line generated.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
. The screen will be switched into the Statistics Panel where the trend lines will be generated.
+
