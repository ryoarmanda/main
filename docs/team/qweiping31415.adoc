== PROJECT: MooLah

== Overview

This portfolio aims to document my contributions to MooLah

My team of 4 Computer Science students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic Command
Line Interface desktop application AddressBook - Level 3 for our Software Engineering project.
Over 6 weeks, we chose to morph it into a finance tracker application called MooLah. This enhanced application
allows the typical NUS student to manage past expenses with the use of budgets, reminders for
future expenses, helpful statistics and user-friendly input formats. It is written in Java, and has about 23k LoC.
My main developer responsibility in the team consists of the statistics features across every component.


== Summary of contributions

* *Big feature*: I have added *the ability to generate statistics* in MooLah
** What it does: This features consists of a basic summary of expenses, a side-to-side comparison
as well as a trend analysis across different periods of time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the lack of analytic tools
to make sense of data is a potential reasons for the problem of poor spending habits to be snowballed.
The inclusion of a statistics feature addresses this directly, with varying levels of depths and
visual representation the user can choose from.
** Highlights: As the feature is closely coupled to the budget features and requires to support other dependencies such as
undo/redo, constant coordination with other developers is required.

** Documentation:
*** Documented new statistics features in User Guide
*** Added the implementation of Statistics in Developerâ€™s Guide

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|We had to update the original AddressBook - Level 3 with instruction for the enhancement that we have added.
The following is an excerpt from our MooLah User Guide, showing additions that I have made for
the Statistics features.
